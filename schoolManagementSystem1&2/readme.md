- So here u can utilize all these concept. 
    - U dont need any other project. 
        - For an example, you can have different type of students 
            - like part time 
            - full time, 
            - undergraduate 
            - and postgraduate etc. 
        - Then have a common abstract class like student 
            - and have sub classes for different categories. 
        - Define interface 
            - and implement that interace in those student classes, 
            - define common functionality in that interface. 
                - Like get student, 
                - add student etc. 
            - This common function will be implemented in the abstract class
            - And override the methods in those sub classes whenever needed, 
                - like getting student in post graduate class will be specific to get only postgraduate student. 
        - U can override the abstract class method in this sub class post graduate student
